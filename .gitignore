# Build artifacts:
#   - build/bin/       ignored  (compiled binaries, not for source control)
#   - build/darwin/    tracked  (Info.plist, app manifests)
#   - build/windows/   tracked  (icon, manifests)
#   - build/*.png      tracked  (app icons)
#
# The two lines below un-ignore build/ in case a parent .gitignore ignores it
# (monorepo context). In a standalone repo they are harmless no-ops.
